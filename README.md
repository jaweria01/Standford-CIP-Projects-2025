**📚 Stanford Code in Place 2025 Projects**

Welcome to my Stanford Code in Place (CIP) 2025 repository!
This repo contains the mini projects, exercises, and final project I built during the 6-week course offered by Stanford University.

**🗂️ About Code in Place**

Code in Place (CIP) is a free, global online course based on Stanford’s introductory computer science curriculum.
Over 6 weeks, I learned the foundations of programming using Python — combining theory with fun, hands-on projects.

**🧩 What I Learned**

Week 1: Welcome & Orientation
Week 2: Stepwise Refinement — breaking problems into manageable parts
Week 3: Intro to Python — syntax, variables, expressions
Week 4: Python Control Flow — conditionals, loops, and basic algorithms
Week 5: Graphics — drawing shapes, handling user input, interactive programs
Week 6: Data — lists, dictionaries, and storing information

**🎉 Final Project**

As a culmination of the course, I built a simple interactive game, Catch the Circle, using the graphics library taught in CIP. The project combines random placement, mouse click detection, score tracking, and real-time feedback — showcasing the skills I gained in Python and event-driven programming.

**✨ What’s Inside**

Mini Projects: Small, creative exercises for each topic (memory matching game, shape placement, etc.)
Final Project: Complete working version of Catch the Circle
Learning Notes: Code that highlights how I practiced core concepts

**📌 Technologies Used**

Python 3
Simple graphics library (CIP recommended graphics.py)

**🙌 Credits**

Thanks to the Code in Place team, Stanford instructors, and volunteer section leaders for making this experience accessible and inspiring!

Feel free to fork or explore the code — I hope it helps you learn too!
